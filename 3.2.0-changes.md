This version includes a full internal rewrite of all source code.
* Added additional information to the documentation.
* Updated the README.
* Rewrote the typings to hopefully work.
* **Patron will now automatically detect which Discord API library is being used** (via a pre-install script). Multiple libraries aren't supported, and the Discord API library must be installed first. TypeScript users who wish to switch Discord API libraries will need to reinstall patron, however JavaScript users don't need to do this.
* **Patron has support for ECMAScript modules.** This feature is now in both the LTS (behind a flag) and Current versions of Node.js, and can be enabled by setting the `type` property in your `package.json` file to `"module"`, or using the `.mjs` file extention.
  * Instead of `RequireAll()`, ECMAScript modules will have an `ImportAll()` method exported.
  * `RequireAll.Sync()` was changed to it's own functon, `RequireAllSync()`.
* Renamed the `CommandError` enums to `ResultType`.
  * Added `ResultType.Success`, which replaces the `Result.success` property.
  * Renamed the `CommandError.BotPermission` enum to `ResultType.ClientPermission`.
  * Renamed the `CommandError.Command` enum to `ResultType.Execution`.
  * Renamed the `CommandError.Exception` enum to `ResultType.Error`.
  * Renamed the `CommandError.InvalidArgCount` enum to `ResultType.ArgumentCount`.
  * Renamed the `CommandError.InvalidContext` enum to `ResultType.Context`.
  * Renamed the `CommandError.UnknownCmd` enum to `ResultType.Unknown`.
* Changed the type of the `Library` enums from `string` to `Symbol`.
* Removed the `description` properties from every structure except for `Command`s and `Group`s, and they now default to undefined instead of an empty string.
* Renamed most structure shorthand properties and parameters (eg. `args` or `cmd`) to their full version.
* `Argument.name` and `Argument.key` will now default to the value of `Argument.type`.
* `ArgumentPrecondition.run()` and `Precondition.run()` are no longer required to return the result in a Promise.
* The `value` parameter of `ArgumentPrecondition.run()` is now first.
* Renamed `Command.botPermissions` to `Command.clientPermissions`.
* Revamped how `Command`s work with `Group`s.
  * `Command`s are no longer required to be in a group.
  * `Group`s can now have a cooldown that will be used whenever any command in the group is ran, fully separately from any cooldowns the command itself has, and limits all commands in the group at once.
  * Removed the redundant `Group.commands` property, a `Registry.getGroupedCommands(groupName)` method was added as a replacement.
* Removed `Command.hasCooldown`, this can be determined by checking if `Command.cooldowns` is defined.
* `Cooldown.getExample()` and `Cooldown.getUsage()` now have an optional prefix parameter.
* `Cooldown.getExample()` will now return `undefined` if any of the command's arguments don't have an example.
* Added `Cooldown.aggressive`, when enabled the cooldown will be set back to the full duration every time it's used past the limit.
* `Postcondition.run()`'s second argument is a value that can be passed using `ExecutionResult`s instead of a result.
* The `input` parameter of `TypeReader.read()` is now first.
* Removed `Result.errorReason`.
* Renamed `Result.commandError` to `Result.type`.
* Added `CooldownResult.group`, which will be the group the cooldown was on, or undefined if it was on a command.
* Renamed `ExceptionResult` to `ErrorResult`.
* Renamed `InvalidContextResult` to `ContextResult`.
* The `CommandResult` class now handles unknown command and invalid argument count results, which replaces the `ArgumentResult` class. A new `ExecutionResult` class will be used for the original functionality of the `CommandResult` class, specifically reverting cooldowns and passing a value to all postconditions.
* Added `ExecutionResult.fromSuccess()`, which passes a value to all postconditions but doesn't revert cooldowns.
* Made many changes to the default TypeReaders.
  * Multiple bugs in various readers were patched.
  * The `BooleanReader` accepts more strings, including "on" and "off".
  * The `ColorReader` now only parses hex colors.
  * The `IntegerReader` no longer accepts unsafe integers.
  * The `TimeReader` no longer accepts large or negative numbers. Centuries and decades are no longer valid units of time. If only a unit of time is specified, it will now be parsed as one of that unit.
  * Removed all channel readers except for the `GuildChannel` one, which was renamed to `ChannelReader`.
  * Removed the `GuildEmojiReader`, identical functionality can easily be done with an `ArgumentPrecondition` and the `EmojiReader`.
* Fixed the Registry's validation of infinite or remainder `Argument`s.
* The Registry now uses `Map`s instead of `Array`s for storage due to improved performance.
* The Registry will now throw when you attempt to unregister anything in use by other registered items.
* Undocumented all `Handler` methods except for `Handler.run()` to avoid potential confusion and allow for better use of internals. Any other methods now have no guarantees.
* Changed the `Mutex` and `MultiMutex` classes to be more directly used. Instead of a sync() method, there are now lock() and unlock() methods instead.
* No longer exported the `MultiMutex` class, the use cases for it are too rare and just exporting the `Mutex` class can cover those with a little work.
